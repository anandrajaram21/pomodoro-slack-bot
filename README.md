# Simple Pomodoro Slack Bot

There are slight issues with consistency of the timer which needs to be fixed. The publishing of the view to Slack and updating of the timer are not exactly synchronized, which results in this delay. Need to find better ways of fixing that.

Available features:

1. Starting the timer
2. Pausing the timer
3. Resuming the timer
4. Stopping the timer

Fixes will be made
